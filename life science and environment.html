                            Life Science is a boundless field which encompasses all areas of science that include systematic study of living organisms such as methodical study of the living organisms such as human beings, plants and animals. Two broad sub-sections of life sciences
                            are - Medicine and Biology. Life scientists are mostly involved in the research and development. Specialized fields in the life sciences includes - Biodynamic, Cognitive Neuroscience, Evolutionary Genetics, Tissue Engineering,
                            Molecular Biology and Neuro-informatics to name a few. Environmental science is basically the study of the conservation of energy, biodiversity, climatic change, groundwater and soil contamination and also for the treatment
                            of air, water and noise pollution. It has emerged as a sought after career all over the globe since people have become aware and are ready to take the responsibility of keeping the environment clean. Specialized fields include
                            - Ecology, Environmental Planning, and Pollution Biology etc. Candidate needs to pursue science subjects i.e. physics, chemistry, biology at 10+2 level to proceed for the higher studies in these courses further. Some of the
                            major recruiters include - Hospitals, Pharmaceutical Companies, Government Organizations, Reserach Centres etc. Trending Fields include - Ecologists, Molecular Biology, Environmental Science </p>
