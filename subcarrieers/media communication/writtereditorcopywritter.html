                                    comparatively less research work, copywriters work involves more of research, editing and less of writing. <br> Editors often start out as writers, and in many cases their role involves substantial writing. They help
                                    writer&#39;s craft stories, make sure writers adhere to style guidelines and rules of grammar, and ensure that every article is suitable for a particular publication. Editors straddle management and production, often
                                    managing writers and budgets, setting deadlines, scheduling what will run and when, and enforcing general editorial standards of quality.</p>
