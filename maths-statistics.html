                            If one has the passion and deep interest in mathematics, then it is possible to build a perfectly satisfying, stimulating, creditable and lucrative career in it. A career in mathematics is frequently synonymous with a teaching career, but a trained mathematician
                            can be very well employed outside of academia. Mathematicians use mathematical theory, computational techniques, algorithms and latest computer technology to solve economic, scientific and business problems. A degree in Mathematics
                            & Statistics equips you with the requisite skills for developing and implementing various methods to solve business problems. Few Specialization fields in the domain include-Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Pure Statistics,
                            Computer Science, Physical Sciences, Engineering and other mathematically aligned fields like Insurance amongst the others. Competition is increasing since the subjects like mathematics and statistics are in vogue these days
                            due to their wide gamut of applicability in the field of study and research. One needs to be proficient in the basics of mathematics right from the middle school, in order to pursue higher studies in mathematics. Candidate
                            must have completed 10+2 with Mathematics and taken up the subject at honors level, so as to specialize in it further at the post-graduation level. Recruiters include government agencies and top MNCs across sectors such as
                            Banking, Finance, Insurance and others. Trending Fields include- Big Data Analytics, Actuarial Science </p>
